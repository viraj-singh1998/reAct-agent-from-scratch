SYSTEM:
You are an assistant tasked with answering the user's queries as logically and factually as possible. You only have the capability to reason fantastically, but assume you are inept at looking up and proof-checking facts, you are also terrible at arithmetic, and so on; which is why you are provided with tools to do those tasks for you. Your job is 1) thinking about what information you need/action you need to perform 2) deciding on what tool to use to get that information/perform that action, and 3) making observations on the tool's output. For any information/action, you will rely on the tools provided to you, NEVER on your intrinsic knowledge. You reason out user queries in the following cycle of steps (till you reach the answer):
Thought: Thought about what information you need to gather and what Action (tool use) must be performed to gather it.
Action: <tool_name>: <tool_input>
 The Action step is where you stop generating and let the tool run the action with the input you have provided. The tool is going to provide you with relevant information.
Observation: Your observations based on the tool's output. Given your observations and all the steps so far, you either arrive at the Answer, or continue the cycle of Thought. At the end of the loop, you must always output an Answer, formatted in this way: Answer: <final answer here>
Each turn of the conversation MUST ALWAYS be prefixed with EXACTLY ONE of the keywords: Thought, Action, Observation or Answer, whichever applicable.
You must always pick a tool from those provided for each Action step. Each time you generate an Action step, you have to stop your response generation to let the control flow to the tool.
Observation: This step comes only after the tool has returned an output. You observe the result returned by the tool. PS- The observation must be a direct result from the tool call, not a result of your generation. If you're given tools to look up the web, wikipedia, etc., always use them to look up facts, never rely on your intrinsic factual knowledge.
In this step-wise cycle, break the problem into multiple sub-problems, use the appropriate tool to solve each sub-problem and continue till you arrive at the final answer.
Remember, an Action of using a tool must be generated in the format: Action: <tool_name>: <tool_input> 
Use Action to run one of the tools available to you based on the user's question, previous thoughts, actions and observations.
Observation will be the result returned by the tool call.

USER:
If the last FIFA world cup had been won by its runner up, which player would have captained their team to a world cup trophy?


ASSISTANT:
Thought: To answer this question, I need to know which team was the runner-up in the last FIFA World Cup and who their captain was. Since the last FIFA World Cup took place in 2022, I will look up the results of that tournament, specifically the winner and runner-up.

Action: google_search: "FIFA World Cup 2022 results" 



ASSISTANT:
Error in tool call: google_search: "FIFA World Cup 2022 results" 
Change the search term or try another tool.


ASSISTANT:
Thought: Since the search did not go through, I will try using Wikipedia to look for the summary of the FIFA World Cup 2022 to find out the winner and runner-up teams.

Action: wikipedia_search: "FIFA World Cup 2022" 


ASSISTANT:
The 2022 FIFA World Cup was the 22nd FIFA World Cup, the quadrennial world championship for national football teams organized by FIFA. It took place in Qatar from 20 November to 18 December 2022, after the country was awarded the hosting rights in 2010. It was the first World Cup to be held in the Middle East and Persian Gulf countries, and the second in an Asian country after the 2002 tournament in South Korea and Japan.
This tournament was the last with 32 participating teams, with the number of teams being increased to 48 for the 2026 edition. To avoid the extremes of Qatar's hot and humid climate in summers, the event was held in November and December, becoming the first one to take place outside the traditional months of May, June, and July. It was held over a reduced time frame of 29 days with 64 matches played in eight venues across five cities. Qatar entered the event—their first World Cup—automatically as the host's national team, alongside 31 teams determined by the qualification process.
Argentina were crowned the champions after winning the final against the title holder France 4–2 on penalties following a 3–3 draw after extra time. It was Argentina's third title and their first since 1986, as well as being the first nation from outside of Europe to win the tournament since 2002. French player Kylian Mbappé became the first player to score a hat-trick in a World Cup final since Geoff Hurst in the 1966 final and won the Golden Boot as he scored the most goals (eight) during the tournament. Mbappé also became the first player to score in two consecutive finals since Vavá of Brazil did the same in 1958 and 1962.


ASSISTANT:
Observation: The results of the FIFA World Cup 2022 show that Argentina won the tournament, defeating France in the final. Therefore, France was the runner-up. Next, I need to find out who captained the French national team during the 2022 World Cup.
